# Note:

There are too many files in node_module for us to store that in our repo. Please download that separately and add it to your folder before running `npm start`. Additionally, remember to install React, [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/), and React Router Dom (using the commands below):

`npm install`

`npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`

`npm install react-router-dom`

Also for back-end:

`yarn add express mongoose dotenv nodemon`

`npm install jsonwebtoken`

`yarn add crypto-js`

`npm install express cors`

`yarn add axios`

# To run both back-end and front-end

`cd server`

`npm start `

Open a new terminal

`npm start`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Connecting to MongoDB through python

Using Python 3.12
1. Download the necessary python packages by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * Recommended to do this in a virtual environment (can use [venv](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/) or [anaconda](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-python-environments-using-conda-32e9f2779307))
2. Following the .env_template file set up a file called .env. You should fill out the USER and PASSWORD variables
3. You can run the mongoDB.py file to see a simple example of some of the things we can do.

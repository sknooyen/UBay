## Back-end Files Overview
- **.env**: Stores project configuration settings. The mongoDB connection string and port number are stored in this file

- **package-lock.json**:  Records the exact versions of packages and their dependencies, and ensures that the same versions are used in all instances to prevent compatibility issues.

- **package.json**: contains metadata about the project such as name, custom scripts that can be run using npm, and the external dependencies required by the project to function

- **server.js** : defines server logic using node.js and express. This file is run before starting the application and activates the server and database.

-**yarn.lock** : autogenerated file by the yarn package manager that locks dependencies to specific versions, similarly to package-lock.json.

-**Product.js** : Defines the schema for how products are stored in the database. Every field and its associated type is declared and then the product schema is exported so it can be used in product.js

-**product.js**: Implements post, put, delete, and get functions for products. Calling these functions interact with the products table in the database.
